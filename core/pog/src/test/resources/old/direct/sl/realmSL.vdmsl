\section{Introduction}

This small note is simply an attempt to model the basic data
structures and auxiliary functions necessary to represent realms. The
basis for the definitions presented in this is note is the paper
\cite{Guting&93} and a draft of the formalisation of these concepts
in RSL \cite{Tao96}. In this note we will therefore assume that the readers
already have read these two other documents. This assumption is made
in order to avoid repeating the basic explanation of what a realm is
and what it is used for. The specification made here is written in
VDM-SL. 

\section{Points and Segments}

The basis for realms is a finite two-dimentional (in this case)
grid. Inside such a grid we can introduce notions such a points,
$NPoint$, and line (or segments), $NSeg$. The miximal size of the grid
have in this specification abitrarily been set to 10.
 
\begin{vdm_al}
module REALM

imports from TEST all

exports all

definitions

values

  max: nat = 10

types

  N = nat
  inv n == n < max;
\end{vdm_al}

Thus we have a grid going from 0 to $max - 1$ in two dimentions.

\begin{vdm_al}
  NPoint ::
    x : N 
    y : N;

  NSeg :: 
    pts: set of NPoint 
  inv mk_NSeg(ps) == card ps = 2
\end{vdm_al}

Note that segments are modeled as sets with two points. This have been
done in order to emphasise that the segments does not have a
direction. A loosely defined auxiliary function $SelPoints$ is then
used to extract the points from a segment.

\begin{vdm_al}
functions

  SelPoints: NSeg +> NPoint * NPoint
  SelPoints(mk_NSeg(pts)) ==
    let p in set pts
    in 
      let q in set pts \ {p}
      in
        mk_(p,q)
\end{vdm_al}

\section{Auxiliary Functions on Points and Segments}

Given a N-segment the function $Points$ will derive the set of
N-Points directly on this segment (including the start and end points
of the segment).

\begin{vdm_al}
functions

  Points: NSeg +> set of NPoint
  Points(s) ==
    let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s)
    in
      {mk_NPoint(x,y)| x in set DiffX(p1,p2), y in set DiffY(p1,p2) &
                       let p = mk_NPoint(x,y) in
                         RatEq(Slope(p,p1),Slope(p2,p)) or p = p1 or p = p2}
\end{vdm_al}
In order to reduce numerical errors produced by real number
manipulation it has been chosen to introduce a new representation of
rational numbers:

\begin{vdm_al}
types

  Rat = int * int
\end{vdm_al}

With the $Rat$ type it is possible to calculate the slope between two
points as:
\begin{vdm_al}
functions

  Slope: NPoint * NPoint +> Rat
  Slope(mk_NPoint(x1,y1),mk_NPoint(x2,y2)) ==
    mk_((y2-y1),(x2-x1));
\end{vdm_al}

Two rational numbers with this representation may be compared as:

\begin{vdm_al}
  RatEq: Rat * Rat +> bool
  RatEq(mk_(x1,y1),mk_(x2,y2)) ==
    x1 * y2 = x2 * y1;
\end{vdm_al}

The set of x-coordinates between (and including) two point is found be
$DiffX$. Similarly the y-coordinates is found by $DiffY$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  DiffX: NPoint * NPoint +> set of N
  DiffX(mk_NPoint(x1,-),mk_NPoint(x2,-)) ==
    if x1 < x2
    then {x1,...,x2}
    else {x2,...,x1};

  DiffY: NPoint * NPoint +> set of N
  DiffY(mk_NPoint(-,y1),mk_NPoint(-,y2)) ==
    if y1 < y2
    then {y1,...,y2}
    else {y2,...,y1};
\end{vdm_al}

Checking whether a point is on a segment is done by the function $On$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  On: NPoint * NSeg +> bool
  On(p,s) ==
     p in set Points(s);
\end{vdm_al}

To check whether a point is inside (i.e.\ not the end points) of a
segment one would use $In$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  In: NPoint * NSeg +> bool
  In(p,s) ==
    On(p,s) and p not in set s.pts;
\end{vdm_al}

Checking whether two segments have exactly one end point in common is
done by $Meet$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Meet: NSeg * NSeg +> bool
  Meet(mk_NSeg(pts1),mk_NSeg(pts2)) ==
    card (pts1 inter pts2) = 1;
\end{vdm_al}

Checking whether two segments have the same slope is done by
$Parallel$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Parallel: NSeg * NSeg +> bool
  Parallel(s,t) ==
    let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s),
        mk_(p3,p4) = SelPoints(t)
    in
      Slope(p1,p2) = Slope(p3,p4);
\end{vdm_al}

Checking whether two segments have more than one point in common is
done by $Overlap$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Overlap: NSeg * NSeg +> bool
  Overlap(s1,s2) ==
    card (Points(s1) inter Points(s2)) > 1;
\end{vdm_al}

Checking whether two segments are aligned is done by $Aligned$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Aligned: NSeg * NSeg +> bool
  Aligned(s1,s2) ==
    Coliner(s1,s2) and not Overlap(s1,s2);
\end{vdm_al}

Checking whether two segments intersect is copied from
\cite{Guting&93} in the function $Intersect$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Intersect: NSeg * NSeg +> bool
  Intersect(s,t) ==
    let mk_(mk_NPoint(x11,y11),mk_NPoint(x12,y12)) = SelPoints(s),
        mk_(mk_NPoint(x21,y21),mk_NPoint(x22,y22)) = SelPoints(t)
    in
      let a11 = x11 - x12,
          a12 = x22 - x21,
          a21 = y11 - y12,
          a22 = y22 - y21,
          b1  = x11 - x21,
          b2  = y11 - y21
      in
        let d1 = b1 * a22 - b2 * a12,
            d2 = b2 * a11 - b1 * a21,
            d  = a11 * a22 - a12 * a21
        in
          d <> 0 and 
          let l = d1 / d,
              m = d2 / d
          in
            0 < l and l < 1 and
            0 < m and m < 1;

  Coliner: NSeg * NSeg +> bool
  Coliner(s,t) ==
    let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s),
        mk_(p3,p4) = SelPoints(t) 
    in
      RatEq(Slope(p1,p2),Slope(p3,p4)) and 
      (RatEq(Slope(p1,p3),Slope(p1,p4)) or
       RatEq(Slope(p3,p1),Slope(p1,p4)));
\end{vdm_al}

Checking for disjointness of two segments are carried out by
$Disjoint$.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Disjoint: NSeg * NSeg +> bool
  Disjoint(s1,s2) ==
    s1 <> s2 and not Meet(s1,s2) and not Intersect(s1,s2);
\end{vdm_al}

When two segments intersect the N-point closest to the real
intersection point can be calculated by the function $Intersection$.
THe algorithm for this function is copied from \cite{Guting&93}.

\begin{vdm_al}
  Intersection: NSeg * NSeg -> NPoint
  Intersection(s,t) ==
    let mk_(mk_NPoint(x11,y11),mk_NPoint(x12,y12)) = SelPoints(s),
        mk_(mk_NPoint(x21,y21),mk_NPoint(x22,y22)) = SelPoints(t)
    in
      let a11 = x11 - x12,
          a12 = x22 - x21,
          a21 = y11 - y12,
          a22 = y22 - y21,
          b1  = x11 - x21,
          b2  = y11 - y21
      in
        let d1 = b1 * a22 - b2 * a12,
            d  = a11 * a22 - a12 * a21
        in
          if d <> 0
          then let x0 = x11 * d + d1 * (x12 - x11),
                   y0 = y11 * d + d1 * (y12 - y11)
               in
                 mk_NPoint(RoundToN(abs x0,abs d),RoundToN(abs y0,abs d))
          else undefined
  pre Intersect(s,t);

  RoundToN: nat * nat +> nat 
  RoundToN(a,b) ==
    let mk_(z,aa) = if a >= b
                    then mk_(a div b, a mod b)
                    else mk_(0,a)
    in
      if aa = 0 or 2 * aa <= b
      then z
      else z + 1
\end{vdm_al}

\section{Realm}

A realm is modelled as a pair of points and segments. However, an
invariant is included to describe that (.3) all end points from the
segments must be present as points themselves, (.4) points inside the
segments must not be present and (.5) the segments do not overlap or
intersect with each other.

\begin{vdm_al}
types

  Realm ::
    points: set of NPoint
    segs  : set of NSeg
  inv mk_Realm(ps,ss) ==
    (forall mk_NSeg(pts) in set ss & pts subset ps) and
    (forall s in set ss, p in set ps & not In(p,s)) and
    (forall s1,s2 in set ss & s1 <> s2 => (not Intersect(s1,s2) and not Overlap(s1,s2)))
\end{vdm_al}

It is naturally very important to ensure that all functions yielding
reals obey this invariant. Thus, some of the functions manipulating
realms will have pre-conditions ensuring this. In \cite{Guting&93}
the treatment of realm objects is done using unique identifiers for
realm objects and for spatial components. We have chosen to abstract
entirely away from such identifiers and thus manipulate the realms by
the realm objects drectly.
 
Inserting a new point into a realm is done by $InsertNPoint$. In case
the point is already present in the realm no change is made. If the
point is new and it is not included into any envelopes for segments
the point is simply added to the first component of the realm. Finally
the complex case where the new point falls into at least one segment
envelope all the segments which have their envelopes entered must then
be chopped up into new segments going from the orginal end points to
the new point.

\begin{vdm_al}
functions

  InsertNPoint: Realm * NPoint +> Realm
  InsertNPoint(mk_Realm(ps,ss),p) ==
    if p in set ps
    then mk_Realm(ps,ss)
    elseif forall s in set ss & p not in set E(s)
    then mk_Realm(ps union {p},ss)
    else let s_env = {s|s in set ss & p in set E(s)}
         in
           let ss1 = dunion{{mk_NSeg({p1,p}),mk_NSeg({p,p2})}
                           |mk_NSeg({p1,p2}) in set s_env 
                           & p not in set {p1,p2}}
           in
             mk_Realm(ps union {p},(ss union ss1)\s_env) 
  pre not exists s in set ss & In(p,s);
\end{vdm_al}

When one wish to insert segments into realms it is even more
complicated. THis is taken care of by the function
$InsertNSegment$\footnote{The algorithm for this function in
\cite{Guting&93} is wrong to require segments to be disjoint because
that would exclude them from meeting each other.} 
In case the segment is in the realm already no change is
made. If the segment is new and does not touch anything it is simply
included as a new segment in the realm. Finally the segment may
intersect other segments from the realm and/or its envelope touches
some realm points. This is the complex case where all the points in
its envelope and the segments which intersect with this new segment
must be dealt with seperately. Two recursive functions are used to
deal with this. The first one is called $ChopNPoints$ and it is used
for chopping the new segment into smaller segments between its
original end points and the points in its envelope. The other function
is called $ChopNSegs$ and it is used to chop the new segment (which
potentially allready have been chopped into smaller pieces)
corresponding with the intersection is has with the existing segments
in the realm. In this process it is also necessary to chop the
existing segments in the same intersection point and finally these new
intersection points must be added to the points of the realm.

\begin{vdm_al}
  InsertNSegment: Realm * NSeg +> Realm
  InsertNSegment(mk_Realm(ps,ss),s) ==
    if s in set ss
    then mk_Realm(ps,ss)
    elseif (forall p in set ps & p not in set E(s)\EndPoints(ss)) and 
           (forall t in set ss & not Intersect(s,t) and not Overlap(s,t)) 
    then mk_Realm(ps,ss union {s})
    else let p_env = {p | p in set ps inter E(s)}\EndPoints(ss),
             s_inter = {t|t in set ss & Intersect(s,t)}
         in
           let ss1 = ChopNPoints(p_env,{s})
           in
             let mk_(new_ps, new_ss) = ChopNSegs(ss, s_inter,ss1,{})
             in
               mk_Realm(ps union new_ps,new_ss)
  pre s.pts subset ps;
\end{vdm_al}

The recursive function $ChopNPoints$ takes two arguments. The
recursion is done over the first argument which is the set of points
which have not yet been taken into account. The second argument is the
set of segments which have been produced in the chopping so far. In
the base case when the set of points is empty the set of segments
produced is returned. In the recursive case an arbitrary point is
selected and for that particular point the segments which has this
point in its envelope is found and for such a segment the chopping is
done and recursion is introduced with the rest.

\begin{vdm_al}
  ChopNPoints: set of NPoint * set of NSeg +> set of NSeg
  ChopNPoints(ps,ss) ==
    if ps = {}
    then ss
    else let p in set ps
         in
           let s_env = {s | s in set ss & p in set E(s) and
                                          p not in set s.pts}
           in
             let s in set s_env
             in
               let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s)
               in
                 ChopNPoints(ps\{p},(ss \{s}) union {mk_NSeg({p1,p}),mk_NSeg({p2,p})})
  pre forall p in set ps & exists s in set ss & p in set E(s) and p not in set s.pts;
\end{vdm_al}

It is necessary to introduce the auxiliary function $ChopNSegs$
because the chopping up of the new segments with respect to the
existing segments and points in the realm depends upon the different
intersections. Thus, $ChopNSegs$ chops one part of the new segment
every time. This function has four parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first argument is the orginal set of segments in the
      realm. This component is gradually cut down whenever an existing
      segment must be removed from the realm because it is being chooped
      into pieces. However, the new segments which the original ones
      are being cut into are included here instead.
\item The second argument is the one which contains the segments from
      the orginal realm which intersect with the new segment. Recursion is
      done over this argument which is decreased whenever a new one have
      been dealt with. 
\item The third argument is used for accumulating the new segments
      resulting from the chopping of the orginal segments in the realm and
      the new segment we are adding.
\item Finally the fourth argument is used for accumulating the newly
      created points from the intersection points. These must be included
      into the set of points for the new realm.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{vdm_al}

  ChopNSegs: set of NSeg * set of NSeg * set of NSeg * set of NPoint +> 
             set of NPoint * set of NSeg
  ChopNSegs(ss,s_inter,newss,ps) ==
    if s_inter = {}
    then mk_(ps,ss union newss)
    else let t in set s_inter
         in
           let {s} = {s |s in set newss & Intersect(s,t)}
           in
             let p = Intersection(t,s)
             in
               let chop_s = {mk_NSeg({p,sp})|sp in set s.pts & p <> sp},
                   chop_t = {mk_NSeg({p,tp})|tp in set t.pts & p <> tp}
               in
                 ChopNSegs((ss \ {t}) union chop_t,
                           s_inter\{t}, (newss \ {s}) union chop_s, ps union{p});
\end{vdm_al}

The envelope of a segment (that is the grid points immediately above
or below the segment) can be found
by using the auxiliary function $E$:

\begin{vdm_al}
  E: NSeg +> set of NPoint
  E(s) ==
    let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s)
    in
      {mk_NPoint(x,y) | x in set DiffX(p1,p2), y in set DiffY(p1,p2) &
                        (0 < y and y < max - 1 and 
                              Intersect(mk_NSeg({mk_NPoint(x,y-1),mk_NPoint(x,y+1)}),s)) or
                        (0 < x and x < max - 1 and
                              Intersect(mk_NSeg({mk_NPoint(x-1,y),mk_NPoint(x+1,y)}),s))};
\end{vdm_al}

In some occations it is essential not to include the end points into
the envelopes. This is dealt with by $EndPoints$:

\begin{vdm_al}
  EndPoints: set of NSeg -> set of NPoint
  EndPoints(ss) ==
    dunion{pts|mk_NSeg(pts) in set ss};
\end{vdm_al}

\section{Introducing Cycles}

Whether a set of segments form a cycle is tested by the predicate
$CycleCheck$\footnote{In the description in \cite{Guting&93} the
indecing using (i+1) mod m is wrong.}: 

\begin{vdm_al}

  CycleCheck: set of NSeg +> bool
  CycleCheck(ss) ==
    exists sl in set AllLists(ss) &
      forall i in set inds sl &
        Meet(sl(i),sl(if i = len sl then 1 else i+1)) and
        forall j in set inds sl \ {if i = 1 then len sl else i-1,
                                   i,
                                   if i = len sl then 1 else i+1} & 
          not Meet(sl(i),sl(j));
\end{vdm_al}

The auxiliary function $AllLists$ is simply used to produce a set of
all possible sequences of segments. In case one was not interested in
an executable version of this specification this function could be
replaced by a type binding plus a restriction on the sequence of
segments inside the body of the universial quantification.

\begin{vdm_al}
  AllLists: set of NSeg +> set of seq of NSeg
  AllLists(ss) ==
    cases ss:
      {}     -> {[]},
      {s}    -> {[s]},
      others -> dunion {{[s]^l | 
                         l in set AllLists(ss \{s})} | 
                         s in set ss}
    end
\end{vdm_al}

Because the concept of a cycle will be used often we will make a type
definition for it:

\begin{vdm_al}
types

  Cycle = set of NSeg
  inv ss == CycleCheck(ss)
\end{vdm_al}

Given we have a cycle checking whether a point is on a cycle is
performed by $OnCycle$. Similar checks are made by $InsideCycle$ and
$OutsideCycle$ to check whether a point is respectively inside or
outside a cycle.

\begin{vdm_al}
functions

  OnCycle: NPoint * Cycle +> bool
  OnCycle(p,c) ==
    exists s in set c & On(p,s);

  InsideCycle: NPoint * Cycle +> bool
  InsideCycle(p,c) ==
    not OnCycle(p,c) and IsOdd(card SR(p,c) + card SI(p,c)) ;

  OutsideCycle: NPoint * Cycle +> bool
  OutsideCycle(p,c) ==
    not (OnCycle(p,c) or InsideCycle(p,c));
\end{vdm_al}

Three auxiliary functions called $SR$, $SI$ and $SP$ are used
here. $SP$ produces a segment from its argument point and upwards to
the edge of the grid. $SR$ creates the segments which have one end
point on the $SP$ segment. Finally $SI$ produces the segments which
intersect with the $SP$ segment.

\begin{vdm_al}
  SR: NPoint * Cycle +> set of NSeg
  SR(p,ss) ==
    {s | s in set ss & let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s)
                       in
                         (p.y < max - 1 and not On(p1,SP(p)) and On(p2,SP(p))) or
                         (p.y < max - 1 and not On(p2,SP(p)) and On(p1,SP(p)))}
  pre CycleCheck(ss);  

  SI: NPoint * Cycle +> set of NSeg
  SI(p,ss) ==
    {s | s in set ss & p.y < max - 1 and Intersect(s,SP(p))};  

  SP: NPoint +> NSeg
  SP(mk_NPoint(x,y)) ==
    mk_NSeg({mk_NPoint(x,y),mk_NPoint(x,max - 1)})
  pre y < max - 1;
 
  IsOdd: nat +> bool
  IsOdd(n) ==
    n mod 2 <> 0;
\end{vdm_al}
All the points in the grid can be partitioned into three subsets: 1)
the points which are inside a cycle, 2) the points which are
on a cycle and 3) the points which are outside the cycle. A higher
order function called $Partition$ is used to deal with this where
$OnCycle$, $InsideCycle$ or $OutsideCycle$ can be used depending on
the desired partition.

\begin{vdm_al}

  Partition: (NPoint * set of NSeg -> bool) * Cycle +> set of NPoint
  Partition(pred,ss) ==
    {mk_NPoint(x,y) | x in set {0,...,max-1}, y in set {0,...,max-1} & 
                      pred(mk_NPoint(x,y),ss)};
\end{vdm_al}

This higher order function can also be used get hold of the points
which are either on a cycle or inside a cycle. This is done by the
function $P$:

\begin{vdm_al}

  P: Cycle +> set of NPoint
  P(ss) ==
    Partition(OnCycle,ss) union Partition(InsideCycle,ss);
\end{vdm_al}

\section{Relating Cycles}

In case we have more than one cycle it becomes possible to relate the
cycles to each other. All these notions are briefly described in
\cite{Guting&93} so we will not explain these any futher here. The
definitions relating cycles are:

\begin{vdm_al}

  AreaInside: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  AreaInside(c1,c2) ==
    P(c1) subset P(c2);

  EdgeInside: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  EdgeInside(c1,c2) ==
    AreaInside(c1,c2) and c1 inter c2 = {};

  VertexInside: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  VertexInside(c1,c2) ==
    EdgeInside(c1,c2) and 
    Partition(OnCycle,c1) inter Partition(OnCycle,c2) = {};
      
  AreaDisjoint: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  AreaDisjoint(c1,c2) ==
    Partition(InsideCycle,c1) inter P(c2) = {} and
    Partition(InsideCycle,c2) inter P(c1) = {};

  EdgeDisjoint: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  EdgeDisjoint(c1,c2) ==
    AreaDisjoint(c1,c2) and c1 inter c2 = {};

  VertexDisjoint: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  VertexDisjoint(c1,c2) ==
    P(c1) inter P(c2) = {};

  AdjacentCycles: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  AdjacentCycles(c1,c2) ==
    AreaDisjoint(c1,c2) and c1 inter c2 <> {};

  MeetCycles: Cycle * Cycle +> bool
  MeetCycles(c1,c2) ==
    EdgeDisjoint(c1,c2) and
    Partition(OnCycle,c1) inter Partition(OnCycle,c2) <> {};
\end{vdm_al}

One can observe similar ways of how a segment can lie within a cycle:

\begin{vdm_al}

  SAreaInside: NSeg * Cycle +> bool
  SAreaInside(s,c) ==
    let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s)
    in
      PAreaInside(p1,c) and PAreaInside(p2,c);

  SEdgeInside: NSeg * Cycle +> bool
  SEdgeInside(s,c) ==
    let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s)
    in
      (PAreaInside(p1,c) and PVertexInside(p2,c)) or
      (PAreaInside(p2,c) and PVertexInside(p1,c));

  SVertexInside: NSeg * Cycle +> bool
  SVertexInside(s,c) ==
    let mk_(p1,p2) = SelPoints(s)
    in
      PVertexInside(p1,c) and PVertexInside(p2,c);
\end{vdm_al}

For a point we have two possibilities:

\begin{vdm_al}

  PAreaInside: NPoint * Cycle +> bool
  PAreaInside(p,c) ==
    p in set P(c);

  PVertexInside: NPoint * Cycle +> bool
  PVertexInside(p,c) ==
    p in set Partition(InsideCycle,c)
\end{vdm_al}

\section{Introducing Faces}

On top of cycles one can introduce the notion of faces. A face is a
pair of a cycle and a (possibly empty) set of cycles which are
entirely encapsulated inside the first cycle. Formally this can be
defined as:

\begin{vdm_al}
types

  Face :: c  : Cycle
          hs : set of Cycle
  inv mk_Face(c,hs) == 
    (forall h in set hs & EdgeInside(h,c)) and
    (forall h1,h2 in set hs & h1 <> h2 => EdgeDisjoint(h1,h2)) and
    (forall ss in set power (c union dunion hs) & 
           CycleCheck(ss) => ss in set hs union {c}) 
\end{vdm_al}

The possible relationships between points or segments and a face are:

\begin{vdm_al}
functions

  PAreaInsideF: NPoint * Face +> bool
  PAreaInsideF(p,mk_Face(c,hs)) ==
    PAreaInside(p,c) and forall h in set hs & not PVertexInside(p,h);

  SAreaInsideF: NSeg * Face +> bool
  SAreaInsideF(s,mk_Face(c,hs)) ==
    SAreaInside(s,c) and forall h in set hs & not SEdgeInside(s,h);
\end{vdm_al}

Naturally one can define a similar kind of relationships between faces
as one can between cycles:

\begin{vdm_al}

  FAreaInside: Face * Face +> bool
  FAreaInside(mk_Face(c1,hs1),mk_Face(c2,hs2)) ==
    AreaInside(c1,c2) and 
    forall h2 in set hs2 & AreaDisjoint(h2,c1) or 
           exists h1 in set hs1 & AreaInside(h2,h1);

  FAreaDisjoint: Face * Face +> bool
  FAreaDisjoint(mk_Face(c1,hs1),mk_Face(c2,hs2)) ==
    AreaDisjoint(c1,c2) or
    (exists h2 in set hs2 & AreaInside(c1,h2)) or
    (exists h1 in set hs1 & AreaInside(c2,h1));

  FEdgeDisjoint: Face * Face +> bool
  FEdgeDisjoint(mk_Face(c1,hs1),mk_Face(c2,hs2)) ==
    EdgeDisjoint(c1,c2) or 
    (exists h2 in set hs2 & EdgeInside(c1,h2)) or
    (exists h1 in set hs1 & EdgeInside(c2,h1))
    
end REALM
\end{vdm_al}
