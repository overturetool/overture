Known issues
* import of VDM types (UML nested classifiers) are stripped from the definition (the UML nested generalization) used to define them
* import of variables with the VDM union type of quotes (UML enumeration) is stripped from their default values and instead an incompatible 0 is inserted leading to trouble if the model ever is to be exported again
* import of variables (UML properties) with default values are stripped their value
* class name "String" is some how already existing, if a class with that name is imported and having an generalization it is skipped and a wired error is logged:
