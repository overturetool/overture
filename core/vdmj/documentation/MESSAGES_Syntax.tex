% VDMJ Error and Warning Messages
% ===============================
%
% Messages and warnings are numbered in the following blocks:
%
% 0000-0999	Internal errors
% 1000-1999	Lexical errors
% 2000-2999	Syntax errors
% 3000-3999	Type checking errors
% 4000-4999	Runtime errors
% 5000-5999	Warnings
%
% Several messages appear to be duplicates, but internally they are raised from
% different places in the code, and so the exact error number may be used to
% distinguish the cases. Some errors are followed by additional detail, such
% as the expected and actual values.
