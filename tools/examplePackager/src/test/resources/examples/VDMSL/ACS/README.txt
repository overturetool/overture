This specification describes the safety requirements involved in adding and 
removing explosives at an explosives storage site. The specification is based 
on United Kingdom Ministry of Defence regulations concerning safe storage of 
explosives, which in turn are based on UN regulations. 
Details of the specification may be found in:

   Requirements for the Storage of Explosives", technical report DITC 185/91, 
   National Physical Laboratory, 1991.

This example is primarily specified using the implicit style in VDM so it
does not have a main debug functionality.
