\section{The Class Card}

This class models physical cards. Each card has a code, a card id and an 
account id stored on it. The class provides operations to create a card 
and to read information stored on a card.

\begin{vdm_al}
class Card

types
  public CardId = nat;
  public Code = nat;
  public PinCode = nat;

instance variables
  code : Code;
  cardId : CardId;
  accountId : Account`AccountId;

operations
  public Card : Code * CardId * Account`AccountId ==> Card
  Card(c,cid,a) ==
    (code := c;
     cardId := cid;
     accountId := a);

  public GetCode : () ==> Code
  GetCode() ==
    return code;

  public GetAccountId : () ==> Account`AccountId
  GetAccountId() ==
    return accountId;

  public GetCardId : () ==> CardId
  GetCardId() ==
    return cardId;

end Card
\end{vdm_al}
