\section{The Timer Class}

The Timer class is a straightforward periodic timer which increments its 
clock in its own thread. It provides operations for starting, and stopping 
timing, and reading the current time. 

\begin{vdm_al}
class Timer
\end{vdm_al}

The Timer has two instance variables the current time and a flag indicating 
whether the Timer is active or not (the current time is only incremented 
if the Timer is active).

\begin{vdm_al}
instance variables
  curTime : nat := 0;
  active : bool := false;
\end{vdm_al}

The Timer provides straightforward operations which need no further explanation.

\begin{vdm_al}
operations
  public Start : () ==> ()
  Start() ==
    (active := true;
     curTime := 0);

  public Stop : () ==> () 
  Stop() ==
    active := false;

  public GetTime : () ==> nat
  GetTime() ==
    return curTime;

  IncTime: () ==> ()
  IncTime() ==
    if active
    then curTime := curTime + 100;
\end{vdm_al}

The Timer's thread ensures that the current time is incremented. We take one 
time unit for our Timer to correspond to 10 system time units.

\begin{vdm_al}
thread
  periodic(1000)(IncTime)

end Timer
\end{vdm_al}
