\section{The Test Class}

The Test class defines an environment for executing test cases. The
class maintains a reference to a KLV instance, and it provides two
operations, runOneTest for execution of one test event, and runTests
for execution of a sequence of test events. Different kinds of test
events can be executed. These are defined by the Event class hierarchy
defined below.

The data types represent different kinds of categories of results.
