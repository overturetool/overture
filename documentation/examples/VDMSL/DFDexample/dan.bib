  BOOKTITLE     = "Proceedings of the IEEE",
  YEAR          = "2003",
  ABSTRACT      = "The time-triggered architecture (TTA) provides a computing 
                   infrastructure for the design and implementation of 
                   dependable distributed embedded systems. A large real-time 
                   application is decomposed into nearly autonomous clusters 
                   and nodes, and a fault-tolerant global time base of known 
                   precision is generated at every node. In the TTA, this 
                   global time is used to precisely specify the interfaces 
                   among the nodes, to simplify the communication and agreement
                   protocols, to perform prompt error detection, and to 
                   guarantee the timeliness of real-time applications. The 
                   TTA supports a two-phased design methodology, architecture 
                   design, and component design. During the architecture 
                   design phase, the interactions among the distributed 
                   components and the interfaces of the components are 
                   fully specified in the value domain and in the temporal 
                   domain. In the succeeding component implementation phase, 
                   the components are built, taking these interface 
                   specifications as constraints. This two-phased design 
                   methodology is a prerequisite for the composability of 
                   applications implemented in the TTA and for the reuse of 
                   prevalidated components within the TTA. This paper presents 
                   the architecture model of the TTA, explains the design 
                   rationale, discusses the time-triggered communication 
                   protocols TTP/C and TTP/A, and illustrates how transparent 
                   fault tolerance can be implemented in the TTA.",

                   it is essential to consider whether more elaborate 
                   considerations should be made to the reliability of the 
                   communication channels described here in the new VDM RT

                   industry-as-laboratory where close collaboration takes place
                   between academics and developers jointly. It argues that
                   the likelihood of having an impact is significantly larger
                   with an evolutionary approach than with a revolutionary one.
                   Finally it touches upon the problem that this kind of 
                   applied research often is not valued academically in the
                   way it should be.",
