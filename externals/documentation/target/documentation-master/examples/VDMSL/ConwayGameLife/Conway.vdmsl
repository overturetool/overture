/**
 * Conways Game of Life
 *
 * The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
 * each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its 
 * eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
 * At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
 *
 *   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
 *   Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 *   Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
 *   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 *
 * The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by 
 * applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed-births and deaths occur 
 * simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick 
 * (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue 
 * to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
 *
 * Modelled in VDM-SL by Nick Battle and Peter Gorm Larsen and animation made by 
 * Claus Ballegaard Nielsen
