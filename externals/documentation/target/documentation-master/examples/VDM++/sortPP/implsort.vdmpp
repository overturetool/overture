The class {\em ImplSort} is an example of an sorting algorithm defined
by implicit functions. 


\begin{vdm_al}
class ImplSort is subclass of Sorter

operations

  public Sort: seq of int ==> seq of int
  Sort(l) ==
    return ImplSorter(l);

functions

  public ImplSorter(l: seq of int) r: seq of int
  post IsPermutation(r,l) and IsOrdered(r);

  IsPermutation: seq of int * seq of int -> bool
  IsPermutation(l1,l2) ==    
    forall e in set (elems l1 union elems l2) &
      card {i | i in set inds l1 & l1(i) = e} =
      card {i | i in set inds l2 & l2(i) = e};

  IsOrdered: seq of int -> bool
  IsOrdered(l) ==
    forall i,j in set inds l & i > j => l(i) >= l(j)

end ImplSort
