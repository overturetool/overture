\section{The Beacon Class}

The beacon class is an abstract class representing the possible kinds
of beacons. Four different kinds of beacons exist:

\begin{description}
\item[TIV\_D:] speed restriction announcement beacon, 
\item[TIV\_E:] speed restriction beacon, 
\item[TIV\_A:] TIV\_D cancellation beacon, 
\item[FLTV:] end of speed restriction area beacon.
\end{description}

A class implementing the Beacon class exists for each of these four kinds.

\begin{vdm_al}
class Beacon
 
end Beacon
\end{vdm_al}
