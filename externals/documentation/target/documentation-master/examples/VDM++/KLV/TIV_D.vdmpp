\section{The TIV\_D Class}

The TIV_D class represents the TIV_D beacon, and implements the
abstract Beacon class. The instance variables represent the
information provided by the TIV_D, the target speed (target distance
to the speed restriction and declivity are not used in the model and
have therefore been left out). In this model only the target speed is
used. An operation create for setting the instance variables,
operations for getting the target speed and entire information exist.

end TIV_D
