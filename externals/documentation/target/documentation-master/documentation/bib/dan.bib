              semantics for a significant subset of Ptolemy II
              discrete-event models. This is a challenging task,
              since such models combine a synchronous
              fixed-point semantics with hierarchical structure,
              explicit time, and a rich expression language. The
              code generation features of Ptolemy II have been
              leveraged to automatically synthesize a Real-Time
              Maude verification model from a Ptolemy II design
              model, and to integrate Real-Time Maude
              verification of the synthesized model into Ptolemy
              II. This enables a model-engineering process that
              combines the convenience of Ptolemy II DE modeling
              and simulation with formal verification in
              Real-Time Maude. We illustrate such formal
              verification of Ptolemy II models with three case
              studies.},

This paper presents a fully automatic tool for model checking PTA with respect to probabilistic and expected reachability properties. PTA are specified in Modest, a high-level compositional modelling language that includes features such as exception handling, dynamic parallelism and recursion, and thus enables model specification in a convenient fashion. For model checking, we use an integral semantics of time, representing clocks with bounded integer variables. This makes it possible to use the probabilistic model checker PRISM as analysis backend. We describe details of the approach and its implementation, and report results obtained for three different case studies.}

                   get more acquainted with the MDA terminology and then the
                   prototype tool support they have made is made on top of the

  ABSTRACT      = "The time-triggered architecture (TTA) provides a computing
                   infrastructure for the design and implementation of
                   dependable distributed embedded systems. A large real-time
                   application is decomposed into nearly autonomous clusters
                   and nodes, and a fault-tolerant global time base of known
                   precision is generated at every node. In the TTA, this
                   global time is used to precisely specify the interfaces
                   among the nodes, to simplify the communication and agreement
                   protocols, to perform prompt error detection, and to
                   guarantee the timeliness of real-time applications. The
                   TTA supports a two-phased design methodology, architecture
                   design, and component design. During the architecture
                   design phase, the interactions among the distributed
                   components and the interfaces of the components are
                   fully specified in the value domain and in the temporal
                   domain. In the succeeding component implementation phase,
                   the components are built, taking these interface
                   specifications as constraints. This two-phased design
                   methodology is a prerequisite for the composability of
                   applications implemented in the TTA and for the reuse of
                   prevalidated components within the TTA. This paper presents
                   the architecture model of the TTA, explains the design
                   rationale, discusses the time-triggered communication
                   protocols TTP/C and TTP/A, and illustrates how transparent
                   fault tolerance can be implemented in the TTA.",

                   it is essential to consider whether more elaborate

                   communication channels described here in the new VDM RT

abstract = {The target of this research project was a feasibility study for the development of a robot for automatic or semi-automatic artichoke harvesting. During this project, different solutions for the mechanical parts of the machine, its control system and the harvesting tools were investigated. Moreover, in cooperation with the department DISPA of University of Catania, different field structures with different kinds of artichoke cultivars were studied and tested. The results of this research could improve artichoke production for preserves industries. As a first step, an investigation on existing machines has been done. From this research, it has been shown that very few machines exist for this purpose. Based also on previous experiences, some proposals for different robotic systems have been done, while the mobile platform itself was developed within another research project. At the current stage, several different configurations of machines and harvesting end-effectors have been designed and simulated using a 3D CAD environment interfaced with Matlab®. Moreover, as support for one of the proposed machines, an artificial vision algorithm has been developed in order to locate the artichokes on the plant, with respect to the robot, using images taken with a standard webcam.},

	automates and integrates a number of classical safety analysis techniques
	to address some of the problems currently encountered in complex
	safety assessments. The method enables the analysis of a complex
	programmable electronic system from the functional level through
	to low levels of its hardware and software implementation. In the
	course of the assessment, the method integrates design and safety
	analysis and harmonises hardware safety analysis with the hazard
	analysis of software architectures. It also introduces an algorithm
	for the synthesis of fault trees, which mechanises and simplifies
	a large and traditionally problematic part of the assessment, the
	development of fault trees. In this paper, we present the method
	and discuss its application on a prototypical distributed brake-by-wire
	system for cars. We argue that the method can help us rationalise
	and simplify an inherently creative and difficult task and therefore
	gain a consistent and meaningful picture of how a complex programmable
	system behaves in conditions of failure.}},

                   with an evolutionary approach than with a revolutionary one.
