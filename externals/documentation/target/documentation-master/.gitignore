# The next exclusion as broadly targets the OS X icon file "Icon\r"
# (that's a carriage return, or ^M, at the end).  It's overbroad,
# killing any file whose name is 5 characters long, starting with Icon
# and ending with a character not alphanumeric or -.  We'll tighten it
# up if we need to.  We're doing it this way as inserting the precise
# filename (using control characters) doesn't always survive across
# OSes and edits. -jwc/6June2013
