This plugin is an experimental version of a code generator that generates
Java code from a subset of VDM++.

The plugin will indicate if a construct cannot be generated by highlighting
it in the editor using a marker (similar to the way warnings are shown)
as well as inform the user about it in the console. Generated code is
output in the generated/java folder.

Code generation runtime:

The generated Java code depends on a runtime/library to represent VDM
collections, VDM types etc. The binaries, along with the attached source
code, can be downloaded from
<link>

Alternative you can checkout the sources for the code generator runtime from
<overture repository>\core\codegen-runtime

Try to code generate your own VDM++ models:

Alternatively, the VDM++ to Java code generator can be tried on some
of the VDM++ models bundled with Overture - simply import them from the
Overture examples. The code generator is confirmed to work with the
AlarmPP and CashDispenserPP models.
