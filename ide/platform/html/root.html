      <h1>The Overture Platform</h1>
      <p>
        Overture is an open source tool for the Vienna Development Method (VDM).
	      The tool supports different VDM dialects which include the ISO VDM-SL standard, as
        well as the object-oriented extension VDM++ and the real-time extension
        of that called VDM-RT.

        <h2>Additional Overture features</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Overture offers additional tool features or plugins that have
        been developed in connection with other research
        projects. Currently, these features are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/overturetool/vdm2c">The VDM2C
            code generator</a> is developed as part of
            the <a href="http://into-cps.au.dk/">INTO-CPS</a> project,
            and enables code generation of VDM-RT models into C code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/overturetool/overture-fmu">The
            Overture FMU Simulation Exporter</a> is an extension of
            Overture which enables VDM-RT models to be exported as
            Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) . Essentially, this feature
            enables co-simulation of VDM-RT and other formalisms that
            can be exported in FMUs. This plugin is also developed in
            the INTO-CPS project.
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/overturetool/overture-fmu">The
            Graphics Plotting</a> enables plotting of VDM models, as
            they are being interpreted. Currently plotting is only
            supported for instance variables that contain numeric
            values, and which have been declared public and
            static. This project has been developed as part of
            the <a href="http://into-cps.au.dk/">TEMPO project</a>.
          </li>
          
          <p>
            These plugins are available via updates sites and can be
            installed using Overture's update manager. This approach
            follows that of installing any other Eclipse plug-in: go
            to Overture's 'Help' menu, select the 'Install New
            Software . . . ' item and choose the plugin you want to
            install. For convenience, the update sites of the plugins
            described above are all included in Overture.
          </p>
          
        </ul>
      </p>

          <h2>Upgrading workspaces from earlier versions</h2>
	    <p>
        The new Overture IDE is not compatible with workspaces from earlier versions,
		    such as 0.2.x and earlier. Follow these steps to move your projects to the new IDE:
	    </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a new empty workspace (Not an existing one used by Overture IDE 0.2.x)</li>
        <li>Select Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Next</li>
        <li>Select browse... next to "Select root directory" and navigate to your old workspace</li>
        <li>Check the projects which should be moved</li>
		    <li>Tick the "Copy projects into workspace" box</li>
        <li>Click Finish and the projects will be copied into the new workspace</li>
      </ol>
