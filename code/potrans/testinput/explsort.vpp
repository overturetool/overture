% WHAT
%    Explicit version of the implicit sorting algorithm. 
%    This is done by changing the IsPermutation test to a 
%    generator function.

\section{ExplSort}

The class {\em ExplSort} is a refinement of the algorithm described in
{\em ImplSort}.

\begin{vdm_al}
class ExplSort is subclass of Sorter

operations

  public Sort: seq of int ==> seq of int
  Sort(l) ==
    let r in set Permutations(l) be st IsOrdered(r) in 
    return r

functions

  Permutations: seq of int -> set of seq of int
  Permutations(l) ==
    cases l:
      [],[-] -> {l},
      others -> dunion {{[l(i)]^j | 
                         j in set Permutations(RestSeq(l,i))} | 
                         i in set inds l}
    end;

  RestSeq: seq of int * nat -> seq of int
  RestSeq(l,i) ==
    [l(j) | j in set (inds l \ {i})]
  pre i in set inds l
  post elems RESULT subset elems l and
       len RESULT = len l - 1;

  IsOrdered: seq of int -> bool
  IsOrdered(l) ==
    forall i,j in set inds l & i > j => l(i) >= l(j)

end ExplSort
